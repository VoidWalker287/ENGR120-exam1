## FAQ

#### Why do some of the files say exam 2?

The project created beforehand was used in junction with a seperate class, specifically for the second exam.

#### I cloned the repository, but I can't run the program.

This project was made with CLion with the intention of allowing the students to view the source code as part of the answers to the questions on the exam. If you are using CLion, be sure to build the project and run it using the tools in the top left corner of the screen. The standard I/O terminal should appear.

#### Can I use this program without CLion?

Usage of this project without CLion was not tested, but you can manually compile and run the program with any tools you'd like, assuming you add the correct files.
